                Additionally, the charged officer must be given an opportunity to answer

                General Manager shall organize and preside over a special meeting within 
                one month of when the complaints are lodged.  If the complaint is against

                the quorum, a member to organize and conduct the special meeting within one 
                month of when the complaints are lodged.</p>
                <h3 id="6">Article VI – Elections</h3>
                <h4>Section 1 – Election Procedures</h4>
                <p>Election of officers shall occur prior to June 1.  The General Manager 
                will notify the members of Unleashed in May of the time and place for      
                elections.  The General Manager will accept nominations for available 
                positions until the time of the elections for the particular position. 
                It is possible to nominate one’s self.  In order to hold elections, 
                two-thirds (2/3) of the membership must be in attendance.  For each 
                position, the candidate who receives a majority of the votes (i.e. 
                greater than fifty percent) will become the new officer.</p>
                <h4>Section 2 – Procedure for Vacancies</h4>
                <p>If a position for an officer becomes vacant during the regular school 
                year, the General Manager will organize and preside over a special election   
                within one month after the position becomes vacant.  The General Manager 
                will follow the remaining election procedures as described in Article VI, 
                Section 1.  If the position for General Manager becomes vacant, the Music
                Director shall organize and preside over the special election as outlined 
                in this section.</p>
                <h3 id="amendments">Article <span class="caps">VII</span> – Amendments</h3>
                <p>Any member of the group may propose an amendment by submitting a written 
                amendment to the General Manager.  The General Manager will organize and 
                preside over a special election within one month of receipt of the 
                proposed amendment, unless the one-month period is dispensed with by a 
                majority vote of the members.  Two-thirds of the membership must attend 
                in order to hold the vote at the special election.  The amendment becomes 
                a part of the constitution if two-thirds of the members at the election 
                approve the proposition.</p>
