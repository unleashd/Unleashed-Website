                organization&#8217;s goal remains to promote and share a cappella music among <br />
                the University of Washington community.  In order to maximize the <br />

                following Bylaws.</p>

	                <li>The continuation of the auditioned group from year to year will <br />

                  removing an auditioned member from the auditioned group for just <br />

	                <li>Small groups may perform at performances provided that they have <br />
                  the permission of the music director (or co-directors).</li>
